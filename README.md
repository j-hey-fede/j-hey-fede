- 👋  Hi, I’m @j-hey-fede (jac, jhey or jacquelyn)

- 👀  I’m interested in mobile app development including native iOS and Swift, native Android with Java and kotlin,
      as well as cross-platform development with Flutter and React Native. I love building full-stack applications.
      
- 🌱  I’m currently learning workflows, version control and professional app-making processes, particularly in the context of teams.

- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, mobile app development projects and educational content and videos to teach others.
      Please feel free to contact me at the email address below to collab. All ideas and inquiries welcome!
